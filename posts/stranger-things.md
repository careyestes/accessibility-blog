snippet: 'Accessibility features improve the lives of everyone, from permanent to situational. I turn on closed captions when watching TV in my bedroom, typically because my toddler is sleeping right across the hall. This is a great example of situational accessibility, and why it’s such an important consideration when delivering content to users.'

The deaf community has praised the caption writers for committing to explaining these very detailed nuances of sound design, and rightly so. 

Stranger Things sound engineering is well-executed, and the tone of the show relies on these sonic moments. The captions really expound on the current scene and make the audio in those moments feel tangible. [While the writers did admit to a bit of trolling on some of the captions](https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/stranger-things-4-subtitles-team-admitted-trolling), it has consequently allowed certain members of its audience to enjoy the series on a ‘deeper level’.
